1. Installing the Linux Kernel on Windows 10
--------------------------------------------
The instructions to install a Linux kernel on Windows 10 are on the page at:

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

Follow all of the instructions to install the kernel on this page.

Next, follow the link to the "Initializing a newly installed distro" page and
follow all of those instructions.

I used Ubuntu 18.04 LTS and it seemed to work well..


2. Installing the Development Tools
-----------------------------------
You will need to install the compiler and libraries that are necessary for
development and to use OpenGL. The libraries I used are:

sudo apt install gcc
sudo apt install ubuntu-desktop
sudo apt install make
sudo apt-get install mesa-utils
sudo apt-get install freeglut3
sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev


3. Install an X-server on Windows
---------------------------------
You will need to run a X-server on Windows that will display the output from the OpenGL
program. You can find one named VcXsrv here:

https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/

Download, install, and run this program.


4. Set the Display
------------------
On the command line run the following:

export DISPLAY=localhost:0

You can put this in the shell startup file so it is executed every time you start a
terminal window. This will save you from having to type it each time you open a terminal
window.

You can test if the installation works by running:
glxgears
on the command line. If it works then the gears should move quickly. If the gears
move very slowly then the display is probably not connected to the X-server. 
You can try to close the Linux terminal window and the VcXsrv and then restart them (don't forget to export the DISPLAY again).

(The instructions for using OpenGL on Linux are originally from this page:
https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/2855 )


5. Compiling with OpenGL on Linux
----------------------------------
The libraries you will need to compile to use OpenGL are:

-lGL -lGLU -lglut

These will most likely be located in a subdirectory of /usr/lib or /usr/local/lib. The subdirectory that contains them will probably have x86 in its name.

The header files are:

#include<GL/gl.h>
#include<GL/glu.h>
#include<GL/glut.h>

The header files will most likely be located in /usr/include/GL.

Note that different distributions of operating systems may move any of these files to different locations.
